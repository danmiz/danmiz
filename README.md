## Hi there 👋

🛠️ I’m currently working on:
• Building my GitHub portfolio with data case studies (business + SQL + ML)
• Landing my first data analysis role

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:
• Real-world data projects
• Tutorials for junior data learners

🌱 I’m currently learning:

• Scikit-learn pipelines and model evaluation
• Business storytelling with data

💬 Ask me about:
• Translating messy data into business insights
• How to spot what others don’t (anomalies, patterns, inefficiencies)

• Staying motivated while learning solo
